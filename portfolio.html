        <p>Beverage Manager</p>
        <h4>Accomplishments</h4>
        <ul>
            <li class="accomplishment">I launched a brand new seasonal beverage program centered on introducing unique
                menu options on a quarterly basis.
                Each beverage on the menu went through weeks of development and multiple rounds of product testing with
                both
                customers and employees before being officially introduced. After the launch of this program our average
                ticket price increased by 8-10%,
                we saw an uptick in returning customers, and one of the beverages I introduced was featured in Cincy
                Beat as "The Best Lavender Latte to Take Thrifting" in 2021.
            </li>
            <li class="accomplishment">I competed in the national United States Barista Championships in 2020 after
                placing 9th in the Sumner Qualifiers out of 30 competitors.
                I performed a 15-minute routine in front of a panel of 4 tasting judges and 2 technical judges, serving
                a total of 16 beverages over the course of the routine.
                I applied for and received monetary and product sponsorships from multiple national companies including
                Acaia and Rancilio.

        <p>Aug 2014 - May 2018</p>
        <p>Donations Manager</p>
        <h4>Accomplishments</h4>
        <ul>
            <li class="accomplishment">In 2021 I introduced the Getchusomebeans program after identifying a bottleneck
                of roasted coffee donations due
                to the perishable nature of coffee. Since its inception we have redistributed over $500 worth of
                roasted coffee,
                coffee roasting equipment, and green coffee to over 30 marginalized baristas in the United States.
