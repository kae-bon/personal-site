            <h3>the age old question... (and a summary)</h3>
            <p>Although the vast majority of my professional experience has been in the coffee industry,
                I've always been an individual driven by a thirst for knowledge. This has manifested in a few
                different ways, from getting my <span class="text-dec">Bachelor's in English</span> where I focused on
                medieval literature to teaching
                myself HTML
                and CSS so that I could build my partner a CV website.</p>
            <p>My journey with computer programming started in 2021, when I first started digging into educational
                resources spurred
                by an initial interest in UX/UI design. I very quickly discovered, though, that my true passion
                lies in computer programming vs. design. There is nothing I find more satisfying than breaking down
                complex, real-world
                problems into actionable steps and translating those thoughts into code. I also find the process of
                refactoring, optimizing,
                and writing tests deeply enjoyable, and am constantly searching out ways to better my problem solving
                skills and my code.</p>
            <p>Throughout my time at the Tech Elevator Java bootcamp, I fostered a love for <span
                    class="text-dec">full-stack and back-end</span>
                programming. I'm looking to hone my newfound technical skills working for a company that values
                collaborative problem-solving and communication as a software developer.

                    unique
                    menu options on a quarterly basis.
                    Each beverage on the menu went through weeks of development and multiple rounds of product testing
                    with
                    both
                    customers and employees before being officially introduced. After the launch of this program our
                    average
                    ticket price increased by 8-10%,
                    we saw an uptick in returning customers, and one of the beverages I introduced was featured in Cincy
                    Beat as "The Best Lavender Latte to Take Thrifting" in 2022.

                    I was contracted to assist in the ownership transition of the Capital One cafes from Peets to Verve
                    Coffee.
                    I trained two teams of baristas in Ohio (Columbus and Cincinnati) on the new menu, established
                    quality standards, and served as a subject matter expert to
                    answer questions about specialty coffee more broadly. Each training took place over two 8-hour days,
                    where I
                    lead workshops on topics such as pour over brewing, espresso, latte art, and brewing drip coffee. To
                    do this, I had to quickly
                    and very thoroughly familiarize myself with the Verve menu and draw on my mentorship and training
                    skills to communicate
                    techniques and processes to people with a wide variety of experience; most of the baristas were
                    brand new to
                    specialty coffee and thus I had to approach training in a more accessible way.
                    In the end, I received very positive feedback from the baristas on my training skills, ability to
                    break down complex
                    processes to make them more understandable, and time management.
